# Hello ! 

This is a quick demonstration of Nuxt with Supabase.
You will need to install the project using Node v18 minimum. If you don't have it, install `nvm`.

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Be sure to have the `.env` file configured.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


Start the development server on `http://localhost:3035`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Testing

Once launched, you'll be able to connect with these credentials:

```
e-mail: demo@scito.com
password: demodemo
```
